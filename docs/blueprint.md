# **App Name**: Latent Space Explorer

## Core Features:

- 2D Latent Space Display: Display a 2D square representing the latent space, with scaled distribution visualization. Allow cursor hover to trigger image rendering.
- 3D Latent Space Interaction: Implement a 3D cube visualization representing the latent space, with Leap Motion integration for manipulation and zoom.
- Placeholder Image Rendering: Implement image rendering pipeline. Use a placeholder image, as the requested image rendering requires python, but this must be a pure javascript application. Placeholder will use a URL.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Dark gray (#333) for the background to emphasize the latent space visualizations.
- Secondary color: Light gray (#ddd) for UI elements and text for readability.
- Accent: Teal (#008080) for interactive elements and highlights to draw attention.
- Split-screen layout with the 2D/3D latent space visualization on one side and the rendered image display on the other.
- Simple, geometric icons for zoom, rotation, and other controls.
- Smooth transitions and subtle animations for user interactions (e.g., zooming, rotating).
