 * TODO: Replace this function with actual image generation logic.
 * This would involve:
 * 1. Accessing the loaded .pkl model data (which needs to be managed, possibly in a global state or context after loading).
 * 2. Using a library or backend service capable of interpreting the model and generating an image based on the provided (x, y, z) coordinates.
 * 3. Returning the generated image, potentially as a data URI or a URL to a temporary file.
 *
 * @param x The x-coordinate in the latent space (-1 to 1).
 * @param y The y-coordinate in the latent space (-1 to 1).
 * @param z The optional z-coordinate in the latent space (-1 to 1).
 * @param dimensions The desired dimensions of the image.
 * @returns A promise that resolves to a URL string pointing to a placeholder image.
